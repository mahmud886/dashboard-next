            <span className='text-[18px] font-archivo font-medium text-[#333333]'>Notice of Information We Collect And How We Use It</span>
            <p className='text-[15px] font-archivo font-normal pt-4 pb-2'>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience.  This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience better and easier. <br/><br/>
            You may browse portions of our Site without providing us with personally identifiable information.  Certain use of the Site, and any use of the App, including the ability to practice language skills through a video chat session, require you to register through the Site or App, in which case we collect and store information, including personally identifiable information, that is voluntarily supplied to us by you when registering on the Site or App. <br/><br/>
            You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but by doing so, you may not be able to take advantage of our Site and App features and functionality.  We use personally identifiable information to deliver the Site and App to you and to develop analytics and aggregated data that allows us to improve our Site and App.  Once you give us your personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. <br/><br/>
            In addition to the specific usages outlined below, we may generally use any information we collect for the following purposes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li className='text-[15px] font-archivo font-light py-2 mx-3 list-disc'>
                For the purpose for which you provided the information to us, such as to create and maintain a user account for you;
              </li>
              <li className='text-[15px] font-archivo font-light py-2 mx-3 list-disc'>
                To provide the features and functionality of the Site and App to you;
              </li>
              <li className='text-[15px] font-archivo font-light py-2 mx-3 list-disc'>

                To troubleshoot problems, provide you with required notices, enforce our User Agreement (for example, when necessary to protect our or a third party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights), or to alert you to   changes in our policies or agreements that may affect your use of the Site or App.

            <p className='text-[15px] font-archivo font-light py-2'>Log Files</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] font-archivo font-light py-4'>Like many websites, we automatically gather certain information about our Site traffic and store it in log files.  This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information, which does not by itself identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base.  We may link this automatically collected information to your personally identifiable information, in which case it will be used and disclosed as personally identifiable information under this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p className='text-[15px] font-archivo font-light py-2'>Cookies</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] font-archivo font-light py-4'>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.  We use both session ID and persistent cookies on the Site.  A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.  We set a persistent cookie to store your password, so you do not have to enter it more than once.  Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site. <br/><br/>
            We use marketing services provided by Google and other third parties that allow us to deliver advertising to users after they leave our Site that they will see elsewhere on the web.  This is a common practice called “remarketing.”  Users will not see more ads than they otherwise would see as a result of remarketing; rather, the ads they see are more likely to be ads for T sports products and services.  Google and any other third party marketing services providers we use to help us with remarketing use cookies as part of the remarketing service.  For more information regarding remarketing and the ability to opt-out, please visit:<br/><br/>

            If you reject cookies in your browser settings, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Site may be limited.<br/><br/>
            Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)<br/><br/>
            We may employ a software technology called clear gifs, also referred to as web beacons or web bugs, that help manage content on the Site by tracking what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Site users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

We may use all of the foregoing information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. <br/><br/>

            We utilize Google Analytics, which uses log files and cookies (see above) to track certain information about visitors to the Site in the aggregate.  This service captures usage and volume statistics to allow us to analyze usage of our Site.  You can get more information about how Google Analytics collects information at http://www.google.com/analytics/.
